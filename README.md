# Word-Scrambling-using-Python

Project Objectives:

After completing this project, a learner should be able to understand and implement the following fundamental concepts of Python Programming in solving a real world problem.

1.Variables

2.Data Structures

3.String Lists

4.Control Structures

5.If / else statements, For loop

6.Functions

7.File Handling and Operations

Word Scrambling – An Example:

Try to read the following:


"Srbmnacilg wrods is vrey itrensientg. Bscauee even if tehy are srelabcmd, it dosn'et ipcmat our raidneg. Bacusee we dn'ot raed lteetr by letetr, we raed the wrod as a wolhe."

Specifications:

1.The project is to write a Python program that reads a text file, scrambles the words in the file on following rules and writes the output to a new text file:

2.Words less than or equal to 3 characters need not be scrambled

3.Don't scramble first and last char, so Scrambling can become Srbmnacilg or Srbmnailcg or Snmbracilg , i.e. letters except first and last can be scrambled in any order

4.Punctuation at the end of the word to be maintained as is i.e. "Surprising," could become "Spsirnirug," but not "Spsirn,irug"

5.Following punctuation marks are to be supported - Comma Question mark, Full stop, Semicolon, Exclamation

6.Do this for a file and maintain sequences of lines

Hint: use random module of Python for scrambling

Expected Output:

1.On executing the program, it should prompt the user to enter input file name and generate an output file with scrambled text.

2.Output file should be named by appending the word “Scrambled” to input file name.
